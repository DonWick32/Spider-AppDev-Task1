This is an Units Converter app created using Flutter.<br>
We can select various "Physical Properties", and it's "Units" using drop-down menus and after inputting the values, we can convert by pressing a button. <br>
We can also check our own conversion by pressing another button. <br>
Clicking the icon on the top right corner of the screen, will take us to a "History" screen, where we can view all our previous "Converts". <br>
